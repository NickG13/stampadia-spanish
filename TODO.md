# Chronicles of Stampadia

A daily print-and-play roguelike adventure you can play offline.

### Bugs

- [ ] on `play.html` tokens are not placed in the right position when the page is opened and the sheet is not fully visible

### Ideas - Misc

- [ ] i18n
  - Challenge: Descriptions must be still oneliners and fit the _Rooms Table_
  - Challenge: New contents must be always translated in order to generate the same adventure sheet every day
  - Suggestion: Prototype a version with a translated `database` folder and then think about a slim i18n system

### Ideas - Print

**Suggestion:** Export the an adventure sheet using `tools/debug.html` and prototype alternate sheets on Inkscape

- [ ] Larger text in _Rooms Table_
  - Challenge: How we can make the _Rooms Table_ larger?
  - Challenge: How we can make the _Rooms Table_ taller?  

- [ ] Larger _Hero Sheet_ and _Enemy Sheet_ boxes, in order to fit a dice more nicely
  - **Not a problem with 12mm dice**
  - Challenge: How we can make the sheets larger?
  - Challenge: How we can make the sheets taller?

- [ ] New layout
  - Checkboxes on the top
  - Split lines in the room description with IDs
  - Link cell IDs in room cells/room IDs may link to a specific line, that chain the other lines.

### Ideas - Gameplay

- [ ] Items
  - [ ] Prevent a specific enemy action

- [ ] Quests
  - [ ] Sub - ??? - More luck/unluck uses
  - [Â ] Sub - The Messenger - bring messages between adventures using keywords
  - [ ] Main - Customize the boss battle via empty Enemy Sheet cells
  - [ ] Main - Find the boss room in broken teleport style/math quiz

- [ ] Enemies with special rules
  - [ ] New monstr/trap idea: mimic, can use player moves

- [ ] Gameplay
  - [ ] Diagonal movement?

- [ ] Rooms Table
  - [ ] Asterisk for more hidden rows

- [ ] Rooms & Dungeon generator
  - [ ] Black squares like crosswords
    - [ ] Runes that can be broken by events/items
  - [ ] Include a square in a room/Join another room when solving a puzzle
    - [ ] Allows arenas with multiple enemies to beat in sequence
  - [ ] Preset rooms

- [ ] Variants
  - [ ] Roleplay variant: play aggressive or defensive depending on the enemy description
    - [ ] Some room descriptions give pointers to mobs behavior; maybe add a code for each room describing combat strategy for mobs: berserk, cautious, daring, defensive ...
  - [ ] Arcade variant: damage = atk - defense

- [ ] New classes
  - [ ] A class with ignore enemy movement to stay in range
  - [ ] A class with more attack/move
  - [ ] Mercenary: Get gold in combat
  - [ ] Elf/Paladin: a better healing ability. Maybe a Paladin is better fitting instead of an elf here.
  - [ ] Druid: class item (haste spell/potion) to get a third roll once (and use 2 moves from player list and one from monster)

### Ideas - Gameplay (questions)

- [ ] Rooms Table
  - [ ] Circles for HP in hero sheet?
    - Circles are used more to add some *narrative* to the adventure sheet *way too minimal graphics* than for coherence: they are used in the Gold Track (they looks like tiny coins), and as the enemies HP (some players have fun on hitting enemies *in the eyes* or *in the mouth* even if all checkboxes have the same meaning - *is there a hint for for some mechanic? ;)*). The Hero and Enemy Sheets have some space issues and there is not enough space to add circles. So, for now, the Sheets will use squared boxes instead of other shapes.

- [ ] New actions
  - [ ] Resting: when not in combat, 5G to get 1HP
    - Aren't The Helpers enough?

- [ ] New helpers
  - [ ] "Easy mode" item purchase.
    - Is that truly needed?

- [ ] Mechanics
  - [ ] Excess XP/HP to gold
    - Is this a way to buy too much time?
  - [ ] Movement used as "points" and distribute during the turn (i.e. move -> attack -> move)
    - It may make characters more agile and add more decisions but the actual *timeline* battle system, with self-contained coherent actions executed one by one from left to right, it's be easier to understand for non-boardgamers.
  - [ ] Use symbols instead of numbers for interactive elements? [(spades)] instead of [1]?
    - While there is a limited number of interactive elements in rooms ATM and a set of symbols instead of numbers may help players on learning the game, numbers are less narrative (a diamond is not going to be an *ingame valuable*, hearts are not *healing items* and so on), easier to share in chats and forums (you may need an emoji/symbols keyboard), and their *mathematical nature* can be used for some unexplored mechanic (i.e. lifts that brings you on current room + grayed cell value)
    - ...in spite of everything I've merged the Seshat font with the Symbola font with FontForge (I've called it the SeshatPlus - open Seshat font in FontForge, Element->Font Info->General, change Em Size to 2048, leave Scale Outlines checked, merge Symbola font) and implemented the code that allow to customize symbols. I don't like the new hieroglyphic look of the lookup table but the main issue is that unicode symbols are larger than the original symbols, eating space on the rooms table and breaking some room descriptions.
    - Anyway there is a *tools/playground.html* page, if you like to play a little with unicodes.

- [ ] Enemy abilities
  - [ ] PUSH: pushes the hero away, for ranged enemies
    - It takes an enemy slot.

- [ ] Rooms & Dungeon generator
  - [ ] A room with missing [1] that's drawn by the player (and maybe be there)
    - [ ] Quests can create the same effect with checkboxes conditions - that may be never checked
    - [ ] *Implemented but unused*
      - [ ] As {drawItemAt:itemId,roomId} (i.e. {drawItem:1,destinationRoom}). Add a {genericItem:"xxx", isHidden:true} to the destination room to reserve an empty cell.
      - [ ] Unused definition for the manual: draw [1] in room 35: Discover room 35 and draw a 1 on any of its empty cells. It will act as a grayed numbered cell.

### Ideas - Misc (questions)

- [ ] Publishing
  - [ ] Send the daily dungeon via mail
    - Adventure sheets are generated with no server ATM
