# Chronicles of Stampadia

A daily print-and-play roguelike adventure you can play offline.

### Bugs

- [ ] on `play.html` tokens are not placed in the right position when the page is opened and the sheet is not fully visible

### Ideas - Misc

- [ ] i18n
  - Challenge: Descriptions must be still oneliners and fit the _Rooms Table_
  - Challenge: New contents must be always translated in order to generate the same adventure sheet every day
  - Suggestion: Prototype a version with a translated `database` folder and then think about a slim i18n system

### Ideas - Print

**Suggestion:** Export the an adventure sheet using `tools/debug.html` and prototype alternate sheets on Inkscape

- [ ] Larger text in _Rooms Table_
  - Challenge: How we can make the _Rooms Table_ larger?
  - Challenge: How we can make the _Rooms Table_ taller?  

- [ ] Larger _Hero Sheet_ and _Enemy Sheet_ boxes, in order to fit a dice more nicely
  - **Not a problem with 12mm dice**
  - Challenge: How we can make the sheets larger?
  - Challenge: How we can make the sheets taller?

- [ ] New layout
  - Checkboxes on the top
  - Split lines in the room description with IDs
  - Link cell IDs in room cells/room IDs may link to a specific line, that chain the other lines.

### Ideas - Gameplay

- [ ] Quests
  - [ ] Sub - ??? - More luck/unluck uses
  - [Â ] Sub - The Messenger - bring messages between adventures using keywords

- [ ] Enemies with special rules
  - [ ] New monstr/trap idea: mimic, can use player moves

- [ ] Gameplay
  - [ ] Diagonal movement?

- [ ] Rooms Table
  - [ ] Asterisk for more hidden rows

- [ ] Rooms & Dungeon generator
  - [ ] Black squares like crosswords
    - [ ] Runes that can be broken by events/items
  - [ ] Include a square in a room/Join another room when solving a puzzle
    - [ ] Allows arenas with multiple enemies to beat in sequence
  - [ ] Preset rooms

- [ ] Variants
  - [ ] Roleplay variant: play aggressive or defensive depending on the enemy description
    - [ ] Some room descriptions give pointers to mobs behavior; maybe add a code for each room describing combat strategy for mobs: berserk, cautious, daring, defensive ...
  - [ ] Arcade variant: damage = atk - defense

- [ ] Skills & Items
  - [ ] Hero/Enemy - Damage reflection

- [ ] New classes
  - [ ] A defense based class
  - [ ] A class with ignore enemy movement to stay in range
  - [ ] A class with more attack/move
  - [ ] Rogue: Get gold by fights/lock dice
    - [ ] Hero - Dice roll skill: the hero locks a die for other enemies
  - [ ] Elf/Paladin: a better healing ability. Maybe a Paladin is better fitting instead of an elf here.
  - [ ] Druid: class item (haste spell/potion) to get a third roll once (and use 2 moves from player list and one from monster)
  - [ ] Rookie: most of the skills are copied to empty Hero Sheet cells from enemies

- [ ] NPC
  - [ ] The Corrupted

### Ideas - Gameplay (questions)

- [ ] New actions
  - [ ] Resting: when not in combat, 5G to get 1HP
    - Aren't The Helpers enough?

- [ ] New helpers
  - [ ] "Easy mode" item purchase.
    - Is that truly needed?

    - Is this a way to buy too much time?

  - [ ] PUSH: pushes the hero away, for ranged enemies
    - It takes an enemy slot.

- [ ] Rooms & Dungeon generator
  - [ ] A room with missing [1] that's drawn by the player (and maybe be there)
    - [ ] Quests can create the same effect with checkboxes conditions - that may be never checked
    - [ ] *Implemented but unused*
      - [ ] As {drawItemAt:itemId,roomId} (i.e. {drawItem:1,destinationRoom}). Add a {genericItem:"xxx", isHidden:true} to the destination room to reserve an empty cell.
      - [ ] Unused definition for the manual: draw [1] in room 35: Discover room 35 and draw a 1 on any of its empty cells. It will act as a grayed numbered cell.
