# Chronicles of Stampadia

A daily print-and-play roguelike adventure you can play offline.

### Bugs

- [ ] on `play.html` tokens are not placed in the right position when the page is opened and the sheet is not fully visible

### Ideas - Misc

- [ ] i18n
  - Challenge: Descriptions must be still oneliners and fit the _Rooms Table_
  - Challenge: New contents must be always translated in order to generate the same adventure sheet every day
  - Suggestion: Prototype a version with a translated `database` folder and then think about a slim i18n system

### Ideas - Print

**Suggestion:** Export the an adventure sheet using `tools/debug.html` and prototype alternate sheets on Inkscape

- [ ] Larger text in _Rooms Table_
  - Challenge: How we can make the _Rooms Table_ larger?
  - Challenge: How we can make the _Rooms Table_ taller?  

- [ ] Larger _Hero Sheet_ and _Enemy Sheet_ boxes, in order to fit a dice more nicely
  - **Not a problem with 12mm dice**
  - Challenge: How we can make the sheets larger?
  - Challenge: How we can make the sheets taller?

- [ ] New layout
  - Checkboxes on the top
  - Split lines in the room description with IDs
  - Link cell IDs in room cells/room IDs may link to a specific line, that chain the other lines.

### Ideas - Gameplay

- [ ] Gameplay
  - [ ] Diagonal movement?

- [ ] Room modifiers
  - [ ] Room modifiers can be enabled by objects or other characters
  - [ ] Truth/lies on terrain types

- [ ] Enemies with special rules
  - [ ] New monstr/trap idea: mimic, can use player moves

- [ ] Rooms Table
  - [ ] Asterisk for more hidden rows

- [ ] Rooms & Dungeon generator
  - [ ] Black squares like crosswords
    - [ ] Runes that can be broken by events/items
  - [ ] Include a square in a room/Join another room when solving a puzzle
  - [ ] Preset rooms
  - [ ] Arena with multiple enemies
  - [ ] A room with missing [1] that's drawn by the player (and maybe be there)

- [ ] Variants 
  - [ ] Roleplay variant: play aggressive or defensive depending on the enemy description
  - [ ] Some room descriptions give pointers to mobs behavior; maybe add a code for each room describing combat strategy for mobs: berserk, cautious, daring, defensive ...
  - [ ] Arcade variant: damage = atk - defense

- [ ] Skills & Items
  - [ ] Debuff skills to subtract defense to an enemy for 1 round: with 1 round, you can go for die-2/die-3 debuffs; the idea is if you spend a 6 on it you can possibly land 2 hits on next round even with a secondary ATK-3 for example. May be applied to all enemies.
  - [ ] Dice roll skill: the hero locks a die for other enemies
  - [ ] Reveal a room position the player can choose
  - [ ] Damage reflection

- [ ] New classes
  - [ ] Rogue: Get gold by fights/lock dice
  - [ ] Elf/Paladin: a better healing ability. Maybe a Paladin is better fitting instead of an elf here.
  - [ ] new class: druid
    - [ ] class item (haste spell/potion) to get a third roll once (and use 2 moves from player list and one from monster)
  - [ ] Rookie: most of the skills are copied from enemies

- [ ] New quests
  - [ ] room with mob -> room with necromancy lab "I ain't dead" -> respawn mob (maybe in two rooms)
  - [ ] Exchange xp/hp
  - [ ] Use luck/unluck more
  - [Â ] The messenger - bring messages between adventures using keywords
  - [ ] Choose between two items
  - [ ] Optional rooms can be "closed" due to player decisions (falling bridges, closed caves, etc.)

- [ ] NPC
  - [ ] The Corrupted
